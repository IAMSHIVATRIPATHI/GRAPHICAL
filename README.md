### Setting up the environment :
  - Just make sure you have python installed on your system. 

  - Install django with the command :
```sh
    pip install django
```
   - Inside the repository run the following command :
```sh
python manage.py runserver
```

   - Now you can open your browser and visit  http://localhost:8000/ for the home page. 

   - In order to login as admin into the django administration go to http://localhost:8000/admin/.

From then on, you can try on checking out how things work in it. 

#### Thank you
